Hey all! This is my first Bukkit/Spigot plugin so I am open to feedback and suggestions.

 

What does it do?

When you have a BoomRod in your hand, right-click to create a harmless explosion at where you're looking. It could also be used as a explosive tool to terraform.

 

How do I get one?

In-game, type "/boomrod" to receive the weapon.

 

Who can use it?

As of now, only OPs can successfully equip & wield a BoomRod with "/boomrod".

However, any player can wield a BoomRod and explode anyone and anything.

 

Planned Features

Add damage
Option to adjust radius of explosion
Option to adjust damage of explosion
Anti-spamming (disable players from holding down right-click)
Permissions
A better image?
A better name?
And more! (Please suggest any ideas in the comments section)
